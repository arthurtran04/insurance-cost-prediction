# Insurance Cost Prediction

## Introduction

Insurance Cost Prediction is a data science project developed in Jupyter Notebook that applies machine learning techniques to estimate insurance costs based on various personal and demographic factors. This repository provides a complete workflow for exploring, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluating insurance datasets, making it a valuable resource for understanding and predicting insurance pricing.

## Model and Approach

The solution includes:

- Data wrangling
- EDA
- Model development
- Model evaluation and refinement

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/arthurtran04/insurance-cost-prediction.git
    ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook by running:

    ```sh
    $ jupyter notebook
    ```

Then inside the Jupyter Web Application running at `http://localhost:8888`, find the `insurance-cost-prediction` directory and open the `solution.ipynb` file to explore the solution.

## Dataset
